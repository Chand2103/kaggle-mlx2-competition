# Music Popularity Prediction using Ensemble Learning

## Overview
This project presents multiple machine learning approaches to predict music popularity scores (0-100) using real-world music data from the mlX 2.0 Regression Challenge. Our team explored various methodologies, with the **stacked ensemble approach achieving the best performance with an RMSE of 9.0035**.

## Dataset Description

### Challenge Objective
Predict continuous popularity scores for music tracks using audio features, artist statistics, and track metadata. The goal is to analyze trends in danceability, energy, valence, and other musical characteristics to forecast listener reception before songs hit the charts.

### Data Structure
The dataset contains real Billboard-tracked tracks with the following key components:

#### Core Features
- **Track Identification**: `track_identifier`, `creator_collective`, `publication_timestamp`
- **Audio Features** (for tracks 0-2):
  - `rhythmic_cohesion_[0-2]`: Danceability (0-1)
  - `intensity_index_[0-2]`: Energy level (0-1)
  - `harmonic_scale_[0-2]`: Musical key (0-11)
  - `tonal_mode_[0-2]`: Modality (0=minor, 1=major)
  - `organic_texture_[0-2]`: Acousticness (0-1)
  - `beat_frequency_[0-2]`: Tempo in BPM
  - `time_signature_[0-2]`: Meter (e.g., 3=3/4, 4=4/4)
  - `duration_ms_[0-2]`: Duration in milliseconds

#### Derived Metrics
- `emotional_charge_[0-2]`: Valence × Energy product
- `groove_efficiency_[0-2]`: Energy/Danceability ratio
- `organic_immersion_[0-2]`: Acousticness × Duration
- `duration_consistency`: Standard deviation of track durations
- `tempo_volatility`: BPM range across tracks
- `key_variety`: Unique keys among first 3 tracks

#### Contextual Features
- `album_name_length`: Character length of track title
- `artist_count`: Number of credited artists
- `weekday_of_release`: Day of week
- `season_of_release`: Seasonal quarter
- `lunar_phase`: Moon phase at release

### Target Variable
- `target`: Continuous popularity score (0-100, higher values indicate more popular tracks)

## Team Approaches
